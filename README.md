The [Tip Calculator](http://localhost:3000/tip-calculator) is a convenient web application designed for hospitality managers to conveniently calculate each employee's share of the daily tip pool. It has three input fields that collect the `Total Tips` for the day as well as the `Employee Name` and their `Hours Worked`. Managers can then add an employee to a list that will include their name, hours worked, and their share of the tip pool. Employees can be deleted from the list if neccessary.
